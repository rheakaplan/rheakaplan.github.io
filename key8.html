		I know I can’t do much,
		But I can’t see you being hurt-
		It’s funny isn’t it?
		When seeing you sad, makes my heart ache?
		Well, just thinking about all that you told me about how you are right now, makes a tear run down my face?
		That’s because I love you.
		A lot.
		A lot more than you think I do.


		Making time for you is literally something I’d do anytime, because, damn -  it’s you.



		Don’t worry. We’ll figure things out together.
		I am gonna be there for you. Like you are always there for me.


		Because hey-
					All of me loves all of you <3



		I know this is short and I know this isn’t much.
		But hey. You amazing human.
		I love you loads.
						Okay?
		Whatever you go through, I am gonna be there through it all, cheering you on.
		I’ll be the shoulder you can lean on, I’ll be your voice when you can’t speak.
		Together.
					You’ll be alright.
										<3
