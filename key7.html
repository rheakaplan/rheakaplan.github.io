		If I could make a list of my flaws, based on how insecure I am about myself-
		The list would probably never end!
		Ha-ha.
		But you have made me feel better about them.
		Do you know how hard it is for me to smile at my own reflection contently?
		But lately, I have been smiling a little more, without even realising it.
		You know why?

												You.
		Because of you.

		You give me reasons to smile.
		And you make me happy.

		Hey.
		I know your mind is in shambles right now, and I am sorry I can’t find a way to help you out.
		Just know that, I am here.
		I am literally here.
		If you feel you’re too tired to deal with it all, I’ll help you through it.
		I’ll give you my strength. I’ll give you my words.
		I’ll give you anything to make you feel better.


												‘cause you mean the world to me.
