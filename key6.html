		I know you have a lot on your mind right now, and I just want you to know that, it’s okay to have a lot on your mind.

		It’s okay to tear up, or go numb.
		It’s okay to be blank.
		It’s okay to not be okay.

		Because we are humans. And as humans we are flawed. 
		I have always loved flaws. Each and every one of us has a different set of flaws, of varying intensities.
		The contrasting natures, the clashes; all of it makes us all beautiful in its own weird way.

		You.
		You have your flaws.
		And you know what?
		I think they are perfect.
		Because, you are amazing.
		And if these flaws sum up to who you are even in the slightest way possible;
		Then I love your flaws too.
